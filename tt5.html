    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Stars are huge celestial bodies made mostly of hydrogen and helium that
        produce light and br heat from the churning nuclear forges inside their
        cores. Aside from our sun, the dots of light we see in the sky are all
        light-years from Earth. They are the building blocks of galaxies, of
        which there are billions in the universe. It’s impossible to know how
        many stars exist, but astronomers estimate that in our Milky Way galaxy
        alone,there are about 300 billion.

      <h2>How are stars formed?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most
        galaxies. A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion
        Nebula. Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with
        sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its
        own gravitational attraction.

    </div>

    <div class="info">
      <p>
        In fact, most of the stars are shining with a steady light. The movement
        of air (sometimes called turbulence) in the atmosphere of Earth causes
        the starlight to get slightly bent as it travels from the distant star
        through the atmosphere down to us on the ground. To our eyes, this makes
        the star seem to twinkle.

    <div class="info">
      <p>
        A "falling star" or a "shooting star" has nothing at all to do with a
        star! These amazing streaks of light you can sometimes see in the night
        sky are caused by tiny bits of dust and rock called meteoroids falling
        into the Earth's atmosphere and burning up. ... Meteors are commonly
        called falling stars or shooting stars.

      <h2>How do stars die?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Stars die because they exhaust their nuclear fuel. Really massive stars
        use up their hydrogen fuel quickly, but are hot enough to fuse heavier
        elements such as helium and carbon. Once there is no fuel left, the star
        collapses and the outer layers explode as a 'supernova'.

        <h3>Red Dwarf</h3>
        <p>
           A red dwarf is the smallest and coolest kind of star
          on the main sequence. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of
          star in the Milky Way, at least in the neighborhood of the Sun, but
          because of their low luminosity, individual red dwarfs cannot be
          easily observed.

        <h3>Red Supergiant</h3>
        <p>
          Red supergiants are stars with a supergiant
          luminosity class of spectral type K or M. They are the largest stars
          in the universe in terms of volume, although they are not the most
          massive or luminous.

        <h3>Red Giant</h3>
        <p>
         Red Giant Stars A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate
         mass in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated 
         and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature around 5,000 
         K or lower.

        <h3>Blue Supergiant</h3>
        <p>
          A blue supergiant is a hot, luminous star, often referred to as an OB 
          supergiant. They have luminosity class I and spectral class B9 or earlier.
          Blue supergiants are found towards the top left of the Hertzsprung–Russell
          diagram, above and to the right of the main sequence.

        <h3>Blue Giant</h3>
        <p>
          In astronomy, a blue giant is a hot star with a luminosity class of 
          III or II. In the standard Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, these stars
          lie above and to the right of the main sequence.

        <h3>Yellow Dwarf</h3>
        <p>
          Yellow dwarfs are stars of medium size. A yellow dwarf is a star 
          belonging to the main sequence of spectral type G and weighing
          between 0.7 and 1 times the solar mass. About 10% of stars in the
          Milky Way are dwarf yellow. They have a surface temperature of 
          about 6000 ° C and shine a bright yellow, almost white.

        <h3>Brown Dwarf</h3>
        <p>
          A brown dwarf is a type of substellar object that has a mass between
          those of the heaviest gas giant planets and the least massive stars,
          i.e. about 13 to 75–80 times that of Jupiter, or about 2.5×10²⁸ kg 
          to 1.5×10²⁹ kg. Below this range are the sub-brown dwarfs, and above
          it are the red dwarfs.

        <h3>Black Dwarf</h3>
        <p>
          A black dwarf is a theoretical stellar remnant, specifically a white
          dwarf that has cooled sufficiently that it no longer emits significant
          heat or light.

        <h3>White Dwarf</h3>
        <p>
          A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant
          composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense:
          its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable
          to that of Earth.

        <h3>Neutron Star</h3>
        <p>
          A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had
          a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was
          especially metal-rich.
